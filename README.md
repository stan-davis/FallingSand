# FallingSand
## A falling-sand simulation/game written in C++ using SDL2, Box2D, and ImGUI

This is a work-in-progress project that implements a falling-sand style of cellular automata with the Box2D physics system. It also implements a basic terrain generation using the FastNoiseLite library.

## Controls
- Select different elements from the dropdown menu
- Change the brush size by dragging the slider
- Left click to place elements
- WASD to move around the world

## Note
This is not intended to represent a finished product. There is currently weird behaviour with chunk interactions.
