# FallingSand
## A falling-sand simulation/game written in C++ with SDL2, Box2D physics, & ImGUI

This is a work-in-progress project that implements a "falling-sand" cellular automata with the Box2D physics system.

## Controls
- Select different elements from the dropdown menu
- Change the brush size by dragging the slider
- Left click to place elements
- WASD to move around the world

## Note
This is not intended to represent a finished product. There is currently weird behaviour with chunk interactions.
